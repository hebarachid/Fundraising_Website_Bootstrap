# Phase1
Abolish poverty
Introduction:
The website is mainly a charity website for children all over the globe. People can choose to donate either for clothes, food and medication or they can be permanent volunteers/ current volunteers. Permanent volunteers check for poor children and families and add them to our database… Current volunteers choose the event that they want to designate with us for fundraising.
The login page is not yet linked to the other pages because I need JavaScript to do so: The user chooses either signing or logging and when he/she’s accepted the button directly links him/her the pages.
Pages:
-	Index.html: The main mage, it contains some heartbreaking info about children suffering and the urge to help them. It contains a timeline that I honestly checked google a lot to do it –not much info was presented but it looks good now- this time line discusses how Abolish Poverty started, and then some straight-up facts that are used in all websites nowadays which are teem cards. Lastly the get in touch and contact us footer and form.
-	Gallery.html: was created with the help of a previous webpage we worked on during the internship [only the gallery part] but I changed its functionalities however they’ll be presented through java script. After that, we have children narrating their stories and the contact us/footer.
-	Donate.html: A section represented people who donated, try hovering the card and why people need to donate, then the three cards where necessary for the backend part so I can create interesting queries because I provided choices….
-	Our mission: presented cool font-awesome icons and an event list for people to get engaged with and for volunteers to choose.
-	Blog.html: The blog is where people write comments, archive and if someone needs help…
-	Contact.html: I screenshot a map because it needs JavaScript and APIs to be implemented also we have the contact us forum for anyone who have inquiries
-	login.html: was discussed in the intro, it is used to log or sign then it redirects the user to the page.
